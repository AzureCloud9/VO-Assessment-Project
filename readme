Assessment: Van Ons Todo-list. 

Design was mobile only, used iphone 12 pro as reference: "https://prnt.sc/MimGVsfyX-M-".

Made with html, css only, instructed by Robert van E, during the interview to only use html,css since i dont know react yet. so no javascript/react only html,css.

added substitute font so if the main font dont work, the replacement will take over.

all images/svg's arent the same, reason is because i couldn't find a way to download the original images from InvisionApp.

hope my coding style is readable
