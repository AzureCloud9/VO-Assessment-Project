Assessment: Van Ons Todo-list. 

Design was mobile only, used iphone 12 pro as reference: "https://prnt.sc/MimGVsfyX-M-".

Made with html, css only, instructed by Robert, during the interview to only use html and css since i dont know react yet.
so i couldn't add the second "TODO-ADD" since there's no functionality.

Added substitute font so if the main font dont work, the replacement will take over.

All images/svg's arent the same, reason is because i couldn't find a way to download the original images from InvisionApp.


Hope my coding style is readable, 
coded with <3 by Marley.
